Hi! This is my Final Project on HarvardX CS50web Web programming with Python and JavaScript course.

I have decided to make an Learning Management System (LMS) as my web application for my Final Project.

My web application utilizes Python, Django framework, JavaScript, and SQL database.

It is deployed on heroku and its media files are stored on AWS S3, https://smolearn.herokuapp.com/

If you want to login and see the application please use username: john and password: JJ5555555 to login.

My application is mobile-responsive.

I have done a very comprehensive review and you can see it on Youtube.

Please, review my code and give me your feedback, I would be very appreciated.

Thank you!
Have a nice day ;)
